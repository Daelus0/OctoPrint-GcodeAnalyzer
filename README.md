# OctoPrint-GcodeAnalyzer

Look through the gcode for comments that the slicer may have left about the estimated print time and filament used and use those to provide an estimate for OctoPrint.

If there are no useful comments in the gcode, fallback to using the default Gocde Analyzer.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
